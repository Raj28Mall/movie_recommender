# Movie recommender

I learnt Python- variables, data types, string operations, conditional statements, loops (for, while), functions, list/dictionary/tuple manipulations, and basic file input-output.

Learned about NumPy and understood array creation (1D, 2D), indexing/slicing, shape and reshape, broadcasting, vectorized operations, mathematical functions (mean, std, sum, etc.), and random number generation.

learnt about Pandas and worked on creating and modifying DataFrames and Series, choosing rows and columns, conditional filtering, handling missing data (dropna, isnull), reading and writing to CSV files, and performing simple GroupBy operations.

I worked on creating line graphs, bar charts, histograms, and pie charts for Matplotlib. learnt how to display multiple plots in a single figure, add legends, alter line styles and colours, and label axes.

Used the NLTK toolkit to preprocess text: tokenization, stopword removal, lemmatization

Employed CountVectorizer (from sklearn.feature_extraction.text) to convert movie descriptions into a matrix of token counts

Computed cosine similarity between vectorized movie plot summaries to find similar movies
